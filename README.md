# Lisp Intepreter in Haskell

This repo defines a small Lisp interpreter written in Haskell.  The code  is
from the article *Writing A Lisp Interpreter In Haskell* (2006) in 
[defmacro.org](https://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp-in-haskell.html).  

All I have done is to make a few changes so that the project can 
be run with `stack build; stack run` in 2020.
